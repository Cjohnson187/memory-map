# memory-map

A public, real-time, and collaborative application designed to visualize shared memories and points of interest on an interactive map. Users can contribute geographical "memories" that are instantly synchronized across all active users using **Firebase Firestore**, providing a living, shared tapestry of locations.

* **Public Contribution:** Designed as a collaborative platform where anyone can add and view shared geographical points.
* **Modern Tooling:** Built using a modern React setup with TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive styling.
* **Memory Details:** Each point on the map can store relevant information (e.g., title, description, and possibly timestamps).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

1.  Node.js (LTS recommended)
2.  A Firebase project configured with **Firestore** enabled.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd memory-map
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    The application needs access to your Firebase project credentials. Create a file named **`.env`** in the project root directory and populate it with your configuration:

    ```env
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    ```
    *(Note: Vite automatically exposes environment variables prefixed with `VITE_`.)*

### Available Scripts
